I'm using the 10 day trial, which has support for Mac Classic, MacOS X and Windows apps (People with NT and 98 don't miss out!)
<br>
<br>
Here's some VB code compared to this program's code:
Public Sub DoStuff(Input as string, YourName as string, YourAge as integer)
<br>
<br>
Msgbox YourName + ' (aged ' + YourAge ' years young), you said ' + Input
<br>
<br>
End Sub
<br>
<br>
Public Sub DoStuff(Input as string, YourName as string, YourAge as integer)
<br>
<br>
Msgbox YourName + ' (aged ' + YourAge ' years young), you said ' + Input
<br>
<br>
End Sub
<br>
<br>
Notice any difference? No? Thats coz is there is none! It's almost exactly the same!
<br>
<br>
Sure, you say, this program is cool, but why should I ditch VB?
<br>
<br>
Easy! VB is no longer supported by Microsoft. RealBasic is growing all the time! And isn't Microsoft ripping you of all your cash already with windows? Spread the cash around!
<br>
<br>
So what is this program?
It's RealBasic! You can get the demo from www.realbasic.com. Believe me, I might ditch VB (sorry)and turn to RealBasic. I might even PAY to own the full copy!
<br>
<br>
Enjoy! And say 'Thankyou Grayda' for this!
